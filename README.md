# Hello! 👋 I'm Yunus Emre Çiftçi
### Embedded Systems & GUI Integration Specialist | Electrical & Electronics Engineer

As a freelance engineer, I specialize in developing systems that bridge the gap between physical hardware and modern software interfaces (GUIs). My expertise lies in taking live data streams from complex embedded systems (Arduino, ESP32) and making them monitorable and controllable through professional desktop applications (PyQt, QML).

### 💡 Featured Project: Rocket Avionics & Ground Station System

This project is the best demonstration of the integration capabilities I offer to my clients.

* **Goal:** Reliably capture telemetry data from a launched rocket and visualize it instantly at a Ground Station.
* **Hardware:** Embedded System (Arduino) + LoRa transmitter on the rocket.
* **Software:** Arduino receiver at the Ground Station, followed by a custom **PyQt5 + QML** GUI developed in Python to display data on live maps and graphs.
